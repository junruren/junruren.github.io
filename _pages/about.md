I am passionate about innovating at the **intersection of technology, humanity, and business**. I aspire to contribute to the advancement of **autonomous vehicles** as a means of democratizing mobility for everyone.

I returned to campus and became a graduate student at MIT in the summer of 2024. Here at MIT, I am pursuing dual degrees—a Master of Science (M.S.) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at the [MIT School of Engineering](https://engineering.mit.edu/) and an M.B.A. at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/). This unique dual-degree experience is made possible through the pioneering [MIT Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program](https://lgo.mit.edu/).

Prior to MIT, I worked at [SoundHound](https://soundhound.com) for six years on voice AI products. Specifically, I crafted many conversational AI capabilities across English and Chinese. Here are some examples:

* 🥪 Restaurant voice AI that answers phone calls or drive-thru orders 🗣️ _"I want a number 2 sandwich foot long on wheat bread with no pickles"_ ([Press Release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-and-jersey-mikes-introduce-voice-ai-phone-ordering/))
* 🚙 In-car voice AI assistant shipped to Citroën Versailles C5 X in China 🗣️ _"Roll up the windows and navigate to the nearest gas station"_ ([Press Release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-delivers-mandarin-solution/))

Check out my photography works on my Instagram. (I may eventually add a Gallery section to this website but for now Instagram does the job.)

I have an obsession with 🚂 trains and overall transportation systems. I am an avid classical and jazz music listener. 🎶 I love singing some old standards, and I play the clarinet just okay. ⚽️ I play soccer when I'm feeling fit, but regardless, I always (painfully to say) support Manchester United. (GGMU!)
